# Probabilistic Model to Determine Necessity of New GERS-ID in Overture Maps Data
This project focuses on the utilization of various data sources (signals, public place datasets, web scraping, user reviews, or directly verified information) to calculate a confidence metric for the existence of a new place. The goal is to use this metric to reliably determine whether the creation of a new GERS-ID is justified.
