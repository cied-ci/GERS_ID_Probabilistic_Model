# Probabilistic Model to Improve Location Accuracy of Places in Overture Maps Data
This project focuses on the utilization of various data sources (signals, public place datasets, web scraping, user reviews, or directly verified information) to calculate a confidence metric or probabilistic distribution for the most likely locations of a place in Overture's Maps Data. The goal is to use these metrics to increase location accuracy of POIs.
